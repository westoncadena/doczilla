## What is Doczilla?

Doczilla is an AI agent designed to automate the most tedious parts of paperwork. It listens to calls, reads chats, and pulls data from CRMs and past documents to generate and auto-fill paperworkâ€”instantly. Our goal is to replace the billions of hours spent on paperwork with seamless, AI-powered document creation and distribution, so people can focus on what matters most.
